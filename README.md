# RxSwift-SPM-Testing
Project that demonstrates how to properly share RxSwift packages among internal/external projects

The `master` branch shows how subprojecting can help you share RxSwift packages. The `shim-target` branches show you how you can use multiple rx dependencies that share the same RxSwift package.
